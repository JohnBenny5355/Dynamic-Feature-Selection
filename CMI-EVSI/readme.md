# CMI-EVSI Folder Details

This folder contains the programatic implementation of CMI-EVSI method which automates the task of finding the optimal set of Access Points that can aid Anomaly Detector models in detecting anomalies in CPS.

## Table Of Contents

## Dataset folder
This folder contains a test dataset used for determining the performance matrix of the model. Additionally, a link to the google drive containing the datasets are provided since the files are too large to be uploaded in Github.

## CMI-EVSI.ipynb
This .'ipynb' file describes the basic structure and runs only two epochs. 
Performance of the model is not determined from these results. Onlz the framework can be analysed.

## CMI_EVSI_Best.ipynb
This file shows the results when CMI and EVSI are directly combined without making any changes. This model is not practical and needs to be advanced further.
This file is preserved to refer to the changes that is made to the final framework and to show that the two models are not directly combined but edited to bring best results.

## CMI_EVSI_BestResult.ipynb
Best results from CMI-EVSI method. Refer here for performance matrix.

## CMI_EVSI_US06.ipynb
 Performance with a completely new drive cycle.
